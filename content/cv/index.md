## Bio

An engineer, who's doing a little bit of everything, when it comes to building platforms
with epmhasis on reliability and scalability. My strengths lay in AWS, Kubernetes, and building CI/CD flows.

When it comes to code, I prefer Go, but I can live with Python, if necessary - at the end of the day,
it's almost always comes down to Bash.

## Technologies

Tools and languages I interact with on a regular basis, in no particular order:

Go, Python, Bash, TypeScript, AWS, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Groovy, GitHub / GitHub Actions, PostgreSQL, Helm, Terraform, Atlantis.

- Improved the infrastructure operations by adopting IaC approach with **Terraform**
- Increased MTTR by adopting **DataDog** as an observability solution
- Reduced infrastructure costs by adopting **AWS Spot instances** for **Jenkins** agents and non-production **Kubernetes** nodes
