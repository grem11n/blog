I do talks on DevOps-ish topics about both technologies and processes. I can make it in English, Ukrainian, or Russian.

If you are interested in having me speak at an internal or external event, you can get in touch via yrochnyak@gmail.com

### CI Doesn't Start With Jenkins (rus)

In this talk I speak about how we configured CICD process in [Preply](preply.com). I cover not only the technical aspect, but also changes in development workflows, which allowed us to deploy a monolitic application as few times a day without fear.
